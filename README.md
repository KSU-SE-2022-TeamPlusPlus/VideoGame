# VideoGame
The Video Game, for our project. This README file will be updated weekly depending on changes we have made or new ideas that we decide to used in our weekly Standup meetings.

## Game Information
* characters - old man, basketball
* enemies - sprite pack with cute stuff
* main map - man chasing ball with backyard background
* background - custom made pixel art

## Game Design Ideas
* number of lanes - new lanes would have different colored grass, background would change, basketball would be moving vertically
* sideways basketball hoops that give you a burst and confetti
* if you hit a barrier you would get closer to the old man
* hole in the wall obstacles, old man bursts through them while basketball has to time it correctly
* play death frame for enemies when they run into old man
* something that makes the old man "trip" so that you get more time (max of 3, if you pick up more then you get a bonus of some sort)
