## Game Information
* characters - old man, basketball
* enemies - sprite pack with cute stuff
* main map - man chasing ball with backyard background
* background - custom made pixel art

## Game Design Ideas
* number of lanes - new lanes would have different colored grass, background would change, basketball would be moving vertically
* sideways basketball hoops that give you a burst and confetti
* if you hit a barrier you would get closer to the old man
* hole in the wall obstacles, old man bursts through them while basketball has to time it correctly
* play death frame for enemies when they run into old man
* something that makes the old man "trip" so that you get more time (max of 3, if you pick up more then you get a bonus of some sort)
